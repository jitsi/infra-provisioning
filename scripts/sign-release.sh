# Usage:

# You need to create a secret keyring (secring.gpg).  You can use your
# existing one, or create a new one by doing something like the
# following:

# $ GNUPGHOME=/src/debian/mini-dinstall/s3kr1t gnupg --gen-key

set -e
set -x

# User variables
# MAKE SURE TO MAKE THIS DIRECTORY 0700!
[ -z "$GNUPGHOME" ] && export GNUPGHOME="/home/jenkins/jitsi/gnupg-jitsi"
if [ ! -d "$GNUPGHOME" ]; then
    mkdir -p "$GNUPGHOME"
fi
if [ -z "$USER" ]; then
    USER=$(id -n -u)
fi
# This is just a default value
#KEYID=$(getent passwd $USER | cut -f 5 -d : | cut -f 1 -d ,)
[ -z "$KEYID" ] && KEYID="SIP Communicator"
PASSPHRASE=$(cat "$GNUPGHOME/passphrase")
# These should fail if for some reason the directory isn't owned by us
chown "$USER" "$GNUPGHOME"
chmod 0700 "$GNUPGHOME"
# Initialize GPG
gpg --help 1>/dev/null 2>&1 || true

rm -f Release.gpg.tmp
echo "$PASSPHRASE" | gpg --no-tty --batch --pinentry-mode loopback --passphrase-fd=0 --default-key "$KEYID" --detach-sign -o Release.gpg.tmp "$1"
mv Release.gpg.tmp Release.gpg
